When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  We may want to use a remote repository when we are working on our project on remote   computer or when we want to manage our project
  with the help of online community

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By automatically staying up-to-date with remote repository, our recent modification that we have not commited can get erased and we go back to square 1.Further more, it is not necessary that remote repository will be always contains desirable changes that we want to implement in the project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: command used in github for cloning the project directly in the github server 	without pulling down on our local.If we want to contribute to the project but we 	are not authorized to change it then we can fork it into our own repository

clones: clone command is used to pull the project from remote github and creates and 	initializes directory automatically.If we are authorized to make commit then we 	
	clone it and create and push our own commit.

branch: it is local command to branch out the project so that changes can be made on it 	
	without effecting it's original branch.Mostly used for keeping stable project 	
	while development is being done in one of it's branch
